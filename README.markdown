Flimpl
=====

Flimpl, a simple framework. Made in the name of simplicity and learning. This is work in progress. Read the goals, and consider participating in the development of Flimpl.

Goals
=====

Like everything else, Flimpl has goals. Big goals! Here's what Flimpl's goals are:

* Being Simple
* Have well documented and easy to understand source, so it's easy for anyone to become familiar with the source and eventually participate in development, or customize it for their own need
* Require you to code PHP, and not Flimplish
* Fast!
* Secure framework, even for new people, who don't know much about security!
* Have excellent documentation!
* Being able to suit any project
* Help people reach their goals easier
* Framework with new ideas, yours as well
* Powerful, but simple - with a low learning curve

We are far, far, far away from these goals. And we need your help in order to reach them, all of them!
