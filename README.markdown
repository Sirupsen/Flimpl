Flimpl
=====

Flimpl, a simple framework. Made in the name of simplism and learning. This is work in progress. Read the goals, and consider participating in the development of Flimpl.

Goals
=====

Like everything else, Flimpl has goals. Big goals! Here's what Flimpl's goals are:

* Being Simple
* Being a framework, where people can learn something by looking in documented source
* A framework where you can easily learn the source, and participate!
* Require you to code PHP, and not Flimplish
* A fast framework!
* A secure framework, even for new people, who doesn't know much about security!
* A framework, with excellent documentaion!
* A framework, which people can use for any situation!
* A framework which can learn you more about PHP and MVC
* A framework which tries out new ideas, also yours
* A framework with a friendly community, always ready to help
* A powerful framework, but yet simple to work with

We are far, far, far away from these goals. And we need your help in order to reach them, all of them!
