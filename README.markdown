Following is to test if everything works on your system:

1. Put this to your server
2. Config static/other/config.php
3. Run runme.php from your browser (f.e. localhost/runme.php)
4. Check if index.php works
5. Stuff works.

For instructions on how to use this "Framework", check the sample files and the class files.
It's richly commented, and should be easy to understand (else throw me a message).
