 * So, what is this for? Basically it takes all css
 * files in the directory and includes them into this
 * file. And this file then automaticly removes:
 *  · Comments
 *  · Tabs, Spaces, Newlines
 *
 *  It can be included like any css file, because the
 *  content type is set to text/css.
 *
 *  This method is good because it automaticly includes
 *  all the files so you can have nice organization, as
 *  well as it allows you to only do one request in
 *  your documents, which results in better speed!
