<p>Oh hello there! I'm a view file. I'm the part of Flimpl, which makes something appear! What I'm now telling you, is not something which is dynamic - no, no it's static! In fact, you can see how I look behind these bones and templates!I'm located around <b>/application/views/sample/index.php</b></p>

<p>But I'm not all static content, no no. I have a controller, he controls me! This means, I can retrieve information from him! Actually, my controller has something to say to me right now:<p>

<?php echo $task; ?>

<p>Oh damn, I gotta go. Hopefully you learned a bit about me and my mom, the controller! Oh, and you can meet my sister here.</p>
