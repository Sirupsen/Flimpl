<p>Welcome to the Flimpl framework! A simple framework made available to you by <a href="http://www.sirupsen.dk" title="Go to sirupsen.dk">Sirupsen</a>. The goal is to achieve extreme simplicity from the framework, which should have a very low learning curve, while maintaining the power MVC and PHP has to offer. Flimpl wants you to write the PHP you are used to, and is not gonna force you to almost learn a new language. Flimpl is also a great learning tool, for those searching to expand their literacy in PHP.<br/>
To get started with Flimpl, I encourage you to read through <a href="README.markdown" title="Go to readme file">the readme file</a>, to get an overview of how Flimpl works.</p>
